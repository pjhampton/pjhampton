<details><summary>About Me</summary>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>I'm a Full-Stack Engineer - leaning to the backend.</li>
    <li>I favour <a href="https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-24-2022/">being kind, over being nice<a> in all aspects of life.</li> 
    <li>My current work is focused on the confluence of observability and security.</li>
    <li>I enjoy hacking on data-intensive platforms, distributed systems, and database internals.</li>
    <li>My approach to technical problems is reductionist, and I like to reason from first principles.</li>
  </ul>
