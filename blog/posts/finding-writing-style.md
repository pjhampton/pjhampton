    I reflect on my writing style and what I wish for in the future from my blog.
---

I wrote in my first post on this website that my blog was a place for me to write _for me_. When I wrote that post I was reflecting on optimizing the writing process (producing), and not the reading process (consuming). As a personal preference, I prefer concise, non-ambigious, friendly language. In terms of length I hope it will fall somewhere between a tweet and a medium-style blog post. In summary, my goals for the writing style are:

  - **Clear** - should be focused and to the point
  - **Dense** - informative but not overwhelming
  - **Short** - should be able to be consumed over 5-7 sips of coffee
  - **Unique** - opinion pieces and annecdotal experience are clearly marked as such

Although accessability is not a primary goal of my writing, I hope the reader shouldn't need to know Java, C++, or TypeScript to enjoy the content, but most of my code snippets will be in these programming languages.
