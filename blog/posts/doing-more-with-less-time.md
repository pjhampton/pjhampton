A company I used to work for introduced a git-spying tool to report on the quantity and quality of the code a programmer produced - I'm not sureÂ how it would evaluate quality as quality in this field can be rather subjective at times. I don't know one developer at the company who was supportive of this - from what I learned, some showed up at the management office to try to convince them to take another direction. These folks were wise. What non/ex-coders should appreciate is producing high-quality software requires arming devs with next-gen tools to increase output and tighten feedback loops, without causing tool fatigue.

However, arcane tools can be super helpful as I have found recently. Ever since my wife and I had a baby in mid-2022 a side project of mine that I care for took a massive hit as I just don't have the time to work on it as much (fatherhood outweighs hobby coding of course). I was also concerned my paid work was going to take an output / quality hit. First, I decided to make a couple of changes to my setup. For Java / Kotlin programming I am continuing to use IntelliJ but have set goals to get better at using it - learning it dark corners and actually learning the productivity hacks. I have switched to using Neovim from VS Code for everything else (Go, Rust, C++, TS, Python... whatever else). The second major change that I am making is automating as much as possible while relentlessly reducing time-to-prod. A simple heuristic that I am setting myself is that if the code I commit takes longer than 20 minutes to get into production, or at very least a preview environment something is horribly wrong - either with the process that I am responsible for creating or bound to someone else's short-comings. The last major change I have made is using AI-assisted programming which has made significant advances over the last couple of years. I am most impressed by this change so far.

A fun prediction of mine for the next couple of years is this:

> Those who don't use AI assisted programming will not be as productive or grow as fast as the software developers that do.

Of course all predications carry exceptions - I don't think this will apply to those new to the field and those new to their programming careers. Afterall, how would you know if the AI wrote inefficient code? Or, how would you learn programming if a more skilled engineer wrote all the code for you? I think the same applies if an AI writes all your code for you. I'm confident in it as a tool as I have the experience to scrutinize the code in depth and challenge any security and performance downsides.

If you haven't installed the likes of Github CoPilot or tabnine, or asked ChatGPT to explain some complex code you probably should. Over 2023 I will be recommending it to the less senior and less tenured engineers I advise at work, and projects that I am responsible for delivering I will be advocating for its use. I consider it less of a code generation tool, but more of another pair of hands and eyes. I continue to believe that life rewards those who lean into change with a healthy skepticism.
