  This post details the motivation behind my blog.

This is _Take 3_ of starting a blog. I have stories to tell for those who care to read, 
although finding the right words at the right time is never that easy. On reflection,
there isn't any particular blogs I regularly follow. What I have come to realize is 
the best Software Engineering blogs are not written for other people, but in fact, the 
author(s) themselves as a journal of their experiences. The rest is just noise.

The posts that follow are a journal of what I find interesting, challenging, and fun. All 
opinions are baked in my head, and obviously don't represent my clients, business partners 
or employer. Feel free to reach out or connect with me if you wish to discuss my musings.
