          <p>
            I&apos;m a Software Developer from Belfast, N. Ireland. My expertise is in Java and TypeScript, but you 
            will also find me programming C++, Rust, and Go.
            Although I have a few professional interests; I specialise in software design and distributed systems 
            in the context of data intensive applications.
            When not wrangling computers for a living, you will find me working to be a present father and husband,
            meditating, practicing yoga, and working on my garden. I also collect guitar pedals and enjoy learning about
            Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
