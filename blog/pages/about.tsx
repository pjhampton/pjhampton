            <p>
              I'm a computer scientist from Belfast, N. Ireland. Although my heart is in the JVM, you 
              will find me wrangling C++, Go and writing copious amounts of JavaScript. I have a masters 
              degree in Software Engineering and I read my PhD in Artifical Intelligence at Ulster University. 
              Although I have many professional interests; I specialise in  software architecture, functional 
              programming and distributed systems in the context of data intensive applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              When not wrangling computers you will find me trying to be a present husband and doggy dad,
              meditating, practicing yoga, and working on my garden. If my work has helped you or 
              your business please consider buying me a coffee sometime or more importantly - <i>pay it forward</i>.
            </p>
