            I'm a computer scientist from Belfast, N. Ireland. Although my heart is in the JVM, you 
            will find me programming C++, Go and writing copious amounts of TypeScript. I have a masters 
            degree in Software Engineering and I read my PhD in Artifical Intelligence at Ulster University. 
            Although I have many professional interests; I specialise in  software design, multi-paradigm 
            programming and distributed systems in the context of data intensive applications. I care a lot
            about shipping reliable software to production and DevSecOps practices. This site is 
            a collection of essays on these topics and more.

            When not wrangling computers you will find me trying to be a present husband and doggy dad,
            meditating, practicing yoga, and working on my garden. If my work or content has helped you or 
            your business please consider buying me a coffee sometime or more importantly - <i>pay it forward</i>.
