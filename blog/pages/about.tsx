          <p>
            My expertise is in Java, but you 
            will also find me programming C++, Go, and TypeScript. I specialise in software design and 
            distributed systems in the context of data intensive applications. I also enjoy the Linux and SysAdmin world.
            When not wrangling computers for a living, you will find me working to be a present father and husband,
            meditating, reading, and practicing yoga. I collect guitar pedals and enjoy learning about
            Digital Signal Processing.

            If my work or content has helped you or your business consider paying it forward.
