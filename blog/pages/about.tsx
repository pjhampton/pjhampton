            I'm a Computer Scientist from Belfast, N. Ireland. Although my heart is in the JVM, you 
            will find me programming C++, Go and writing copious amounts of TypeScript. I have a masters 
            degree in Software Engineering and I read my PhD in Artifical Intelligence at Ulster University. 
            Although I have a few professional interests; I specialise in  software design and distributed systems 
            in the context of data intensive applications.

            When not wrangling computers for a living, you will find me working to be a present husband and father,
            meditating, practicing yoga, and working on my garden. I also collect guitar pedals and enjoy learning about
            Digital Signal Processing (DSP). If my work or content has helped you or your business please consider <i>paying it forward</i>.
